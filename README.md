<h2>Analytics</h2>
This build uses Plausible for site tracking, rather than the more commonly
used Google Analytics. This is for several reasons. Firstly, Google
Analytics is a heavy package. Plausible is very lightweight and provides
(almost) the same level of tracking. The second reason is I am getting a
bit disillusioned about Google taking all of my data.
